    AI-powered medical diagnosis refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases and conditions. By analyzing large volumes of medical data—such as patient histories, medical images, laboratory results, and clinical notes—AI systems can identify patterns, detect anomalies, and predict potential health issues with high accuracy.

The primary advantage of AI in medical diagnosis is its ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data much faster than human doctors, providing support in detecting diseases early, especially in complex cases. For instance, AI algorithms are widely used in analyzing medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, where they can identify abnormalities such as tumors or fractures with remarkable precision. Similarly, AI models can assess genetic data or biomarkers to predict the likelihood of developing conditions like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or neurological disorders.
